##  You may have missed your job opportunity because of AI 


Many start-up companies are launching services that use AI to streamline the employee recruiting process. The technology enables hiring companies to assess many more applicants by analyzing and interpreting a huge volume of candidate data quickly and cost effectively. But caution needs to be applied here, because the basis of the selection decisions must be legally defensible. That’s not going to happen if you can’t open the black box of AI.

In addition, professional recruiters, particularly those in regulated industries such as financial services, should always know the basis for any selection decision. If it’s not possible to justify exactly why a candidate has been rejected from the application process, it leaves the company vulnerable to a legal challenge from that individual. Inherent bias in automated systems for hiring can result in a legal nightmare.

In one high profile example, Amazon developed an AI recruiting tool that went back and analyzed 10 years of employment applications in order to create a system that automatically identified characteristics of high-performing employees and against those standards, scored new candidates. The tool made headlines in 2018 when it was determined that the algorithm favored male candidates due to societal influences such as gender bias and wage gaps in technology jobs.

We cannot stop building smarter systems but we need to ensure to build it fair.
