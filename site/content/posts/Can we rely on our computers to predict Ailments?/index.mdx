## Can we rely on our computers to predict Ailments?

In 2015, a research group at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York worked to apply deep learning to the institution’s large database of patient records featuring hundreds of variables on patients drawn from their test results, doctor visits, etc. The so-called Deep Patient software was trained using data from about 700,000 patients, and when evaluated with new records, its accuracy in predicting disease was exceptional. The system was able to discover patterns hidden in the hospital data that seemed to indicate when patients were on the way to a wide range of ailments, including cancer.

But at the same time, Deep Patient turned out to be somewhat of a black box. For example, it was able to anticipate the onset of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia surprisingly well. But since schizophrenia is notoriously difficult for physicians to predict, it was natural to wonder how this was possible. Unfortunately, the new tool offered no clue as to how it does this. If a technology solution like Deep Patient is actually going to assist doctors, it really needs to offer a level of transparency by offering a rationale for its predictions to reassure them that it is accurate and to justify any changes in prescription drugs a patient is taking.

How do build a system where we can ensure what the computer tells us is dependable.
